/**
 * Scrubbed environment for TENANT AGENT spawns — the three sites that hand the daemon's env to an
 * agent-authored process: `agent-host.ts` (the omp/pi child a squad agent drives), `omp-call.ts`
 * (one-shot `omp -p` calls), and `acp-agent-driver.ts` (an ACP runtime — `auggie`/`gemini`/`codex`/…).
 * Before this module, all three inherited the daemon's FULL environment: `DATABASE_URL` (and, once
 * the voice plan lands, the boot secret) is readable by any agent via `printenv` or hostile repo
 * content that induces one. This is a live multi-tenant hole today, independent of voice.
 *
 * Deny-by-shape, not an allowlist of known-bad: a var whose NAME looks like a daemon credential is
 * stripped even if this module has never heard of it — new secrets are safe by default. What survives
 * the deny pass is then narrowed further to an explicit keep-list; this is a stricter default than
 * `gate-env.ts`'s pass-through-minus-secrets (gate code runs a developer's own toolchain suite and
 * needs arbitrary vars like CARGO_HOME/GOPATH/CI — a tenant agent process needs far less).
 *
 * `OMP_SQUAD_*`/`GLANCE_*` full-prefix denial is SHARED with gate-env.ts via `isSquadEnvCompatKey`
 * (env-compat.ts mirrors every `OMP_SQUAD_*` var into a canonical `GLANCE_*` twin, so scrubbing only
 * one prefix leaks the other) — one place owns that pair so the two scrubs can't drift apart on it.
 * Everything past that prefix pair is intentionally NOT shared: gate-env.ts denies `PLANE_API_KEY`
 * specifically (a gate suite may legitimately need other `PLANE_*` vars, e.g. a workspace slug for an
 * integration test); the tenant scrub below denies the whole `PLANE_*` prefix, because a tenant agent
 * has no legitimate use for ANY of the daemon's Plane configuration.

 * configured (a multi-provider fleet sets all of them) must NOT reach a spawn that doesn't need it.
 *
 * `harness` (a registered harness NAME, e.g. "omp"/"codex"/"gemini"/"grok"/"auggie") and `model` (the
 * unit's pinned model spec, when known) narrow the result to the single vendor this spawn actually
 * needs, via the SAME `resolveProvider` combinator rate-limit gating already trusts (model wins when
 * classifiable; the harness's static vendor pin is the fallback).
 *
 * Round-2 cross-lineage audit (both codex and grok, independently): the ORIGINAL fallback for "we
 * genuinely can't classify this spawn's vendor" admitted EVERY configured provider credential —
 * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY through AUGMENT_API_KEY, all seven, into a spawn that at most needed one of them.
 * That is not "honest ignorance", it's the widest possible grant dressed up as one: a multi-provider
 * operator's opencode-with-no-pinned-model spawn, or a Flue worker's `harnessAuthEnv()` call with no
 * harness/model at all, walked away with every vendor's key regardless of which (if any) it would ever
 * call. FIX: unknown lineage now fails closed to `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` alone (model-lineage.ts's
 * documented "an unclassifiable unit's provider" answer, already trusted for rate-limit gating) —
 * ONE credential, not seven, for every harness/model combination this function cannot classify. A
 * spawn that genuinely needs a non-Anthropic vendor must be classifiable (a pinned model, or a
 * vendor-pinned harness name `model-lineage.ts`'s `HARNESS_LINEAGE` already knows) — withholding six
 * credentials a spawn never asked for is the correct failure mode, not a functionality regression: no
 * verified harness in the registry relies on the old seven-key grant (spawn-env.test.ts proves it for
