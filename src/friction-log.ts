/**
 * Friction ledger (plans/daily-dogfood-engine/01) — the durable append-only record behind
 * `glance grr`. Every capture surface (CLI verb, webapp composer popover, TUI Ctrl-G / /grr,
 * `glance here` /grr) funnels into ONE write path: {@link FrictionLog.record}, reached either
 * via `POST /api/friction` (HTTP surfaces) or via `SquadManager.recordFriction` (the in-process
 * TUI, which lives in the daemon and has no reason to loop back over HTTP).
 *
 * Storage: a `JsonlLog<FrictionEntry>` at `<stateDir>/friction.jsonl` — the same generic
 * ring+spool used for transitions.jsonl (src/squad-manager.ts's transitionLog), deliberately NOT
 * `automation-log.ts`: that subsystem is hard-typed to AutomationEvent's heterogeneous-metrics
 * schema and gates persistence through `isMeaningful()`, a heartbeat-vs-worth-persisting filter
 * that doesn't apply here — every gripe is meaningful by construction (the operator typed it
 * mid-annoyance). Rationale recorded so it isn't re-litigated; see the concern doc's Approach.
 *
 * The ring (recent()) is the read path for `GET /api/friction` / `glance grr --list`; the file
 * (hydrateAll()) is the full-history path the weekly drain (concern 03) reads.
