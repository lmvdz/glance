/**
 * Single plan-doc read + git-revision helpers for the design-review screen.

 * The review screen needs two things `parsePlanDocuments` (features.ts) doesn't give it:
 * 1. A single-file, path-guarded read (so a client can ask for one doc without pulling the whole
 *    feature pipeline payload).
 * 2. "What changed since I last looked" — the doc lives in git, so its revision history IS its
 *    edit history (no separate audit trail needed). v1 diffs the current working tree against a
 *    single named revision (the last-seen SHA the client persisted) rather than streaming live
 *    edits — see plan-doc-review.ts on the client for the "mark as viewed" protocol this serves.
 *
 * Every git call routes through hardenedGit (git-harden.ts) — the single hardened shell-out
 * boundary — same discipline as explore.ts's worktreeDiff/worktreeTree.
