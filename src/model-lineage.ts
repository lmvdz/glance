 * Model → vendor LINEAGE (for cross-lineage adversarial review, plans/cross-lineage-review/).
 *
 * "Lineage" is the coarser, VENDOR grain of `modelFamily()` (src/omp-graph/attribution.ts): when the
 * same vendor both authors and judges a change, their blind spots are correlated, so the land gate's
 * independent validator is only truly independent if its lineage differs from the author's.
 *
 * Built ON TOP of `modelFamily()` so the two heuristics can't drift — a new model family added there
 * flows through `FAMILY_LINEAGE` here, and `model-lineage.test.ts` asserts every family maps to a
 * lineage. NOTE the one deliberate divergence: `modelFamily` keeps `fable` as its own cost-band family,
 * but `fable` is `claude-fable-*` — an Anthropic model — so its VENDOR lineage is `anthropic`.
